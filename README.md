# Task-Manager2.0
Simple Workplace Task Manager

This program allows an Admin user to add new users to the program. Tasks can then be created and assigned
to the users in the program. Tasks can be added by admin and non-admin users. All users can view all the 
tasks and see who they are assigned to and when the task should be complete. The user is also provided
with an option to show only the task assigned to their username. 

When the user views their own tasks they can choose to **mark** the task as **complete** or they can **edit** 
the task. Editing the task allows the user to change the user the task is assigned to, the duedate of the
task or both.

The Admin user has all the functions of the normal user. The admin is also presented with an option to generate
a report for the tasks and users. The admin user also has a menu option to display information of the generated
reports.

This program is suitable for companies that assign different tasks to different staff members and provides
a tool to easily manage these tasks.

The program aims to make task managing quick and easy and provides a nice way for an employee to see their
given tasks.
